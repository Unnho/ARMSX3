/**
 * RPCS3's per-title recommended settings, fetched from its config database.
 *
 * This is the same database the desktop build offers under "Download Config Database": a
 * curated set of settings that make specific titles work, maintained by the RPCS3 project.
 * The core already knows how to use it. Emulator::Load asks for a title's config through
 * the get_database_config callback and passes it to BootGame as db_config, which layers it
 * under the user's own settings.
 *
 * Desktop does the download and the JSON parsing in Qt, which is not part of this build, so
 * that half lives here. The response is
 *
 *     { "return_code": 0, "games": { "BLUS30443": { "config": "<yaml>" }, ... } }
 *
 * and is split into one file per title under config/config_db/, which is all the native
 * callback then has to read.
 *
 * Splitting rather than keeping the blob whole is deliberate: the callback runs on the boot
 * path, and re-parsing a database of every PS3 game to find one entry would be wasteful.
